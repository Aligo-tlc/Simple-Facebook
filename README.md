# Simple-Facebook
This is a simplified facebook system for my curse work assignment
This facebook system is meant to carry out five operations/functionalities
   1. Users can create user profiles by signing up
   2. Users can log in to their home page after signing up/registering
   3. Users can chat in groups with other users
   4. Users can make posts and commend on posts
   5. Users can search other users
